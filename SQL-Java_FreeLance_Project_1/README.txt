This file is the implementation of all solutions to finding certain items in the database
that meet very specific requirements. All of this is done using SQL queries that return an Array List.

To run this file, start a PostgreSQL Server @localhost:5432/mydb and add the required files in /starter/tablesfolder.
add a new user to this database with user "user" and password "password".
Run this file with 'javac Assignment2.java' and then 'java Assignment2'

A screenshot of the desired output is attached, as well as the required jar for the JDBC PostgreSQL driver.

All 10 SQL queries can be found in the /queries folder
