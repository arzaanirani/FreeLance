All classes are implemented as described.

Turtles can be tested out using the TurtleDemo class, and the respective main classes
in the TurtleFans and TurtleTrees assignment are both runnable as standalone programs.

The Glitch class shows an example of an image being 'incremented' and an image
with a swap probability of 0.001.
